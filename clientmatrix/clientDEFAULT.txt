Contract of carriage: the contract by which the carrier undertakes towards the sender to carry goods by road.\n\n2. Sender: the contractual other party of the carrier. If a sender is referred to in the consignment note this does not automatically mean that the sender referred to is the contractual other party of the carrier.\n\n3. Consignee: the person who by virtue of the contract of carriage is entitled to delivery of the goods by the carrier.\n\n4. The consignment note: the document drawn up in three original copies, one of which (evidence of receipt) is destined for the sender, the second (evidence of delivery) being destined for the carrier, and the third being destined for the consignee.\n\n5. Servants and agents: employees of the carrier as well as persons whose services the carrier uses for the completion of the contract of carriage.\n\n6. Force majeure: circumstances which a diligent carrier is unable to avoid and in so far as a carrier is unable to prevent the consequences thereof.\n\n7.

General Storage Terms and Conditions: the General Storage Terms and Conditions, most recent version, as deposited byStichting vervoeradres at the registry of the District Courts of Amsterdam and Rotterdam.\n\n\nArticle 2 Electronic messages\n\n1. If data, including those relating to the consignment note, are exchanged electronically, parties shall not dispute the admissibility of electronic messages as evidence in the event of a mutual conflict.\n\n2. Electronic messages have the same evidential value as written documents, unless these messages were not sent, saved and registered in the format as agreed on between the parties and in accordance with the security level and manner agreed on by parties.\n \n3. A consignment note drawn up and signed electronically via the TransFollow platform has the same evidential value as the consignment note referred to in section 1. The electronic signature placed via the TransFollow platform is recognised as sufficiently reliable.\n\n\nArticle 3 Scope of application\n\nThe General Transport Terms and Conditions apply to the contract of carriage of goods by road; if the CMR applies, then the General Transport Terms and Conditions also apply.\n\n\nArticle 4 Obligations of the sender\n\nnotice of termination of the contract of carriage\n\n1. The sender is required:\na) concerning the goods and the treatment of same, to timely supply the carrier with all data and information as he is able to or ought to be able to, and of which he knows or ought to know that such data and information are important to the carrier, unless he may assume that the carrier is already aware of this data;\nb) to make the agreed goods available to the carrier at the agreed location and time and in the agreed manner, accompanied by the consignment note as required by article 5 and by any further documents as required by law from the sender;\nc) to clearly and appropriately address each package to be carried and, in so far as reasonably practicable, to affix or append the required information and address to the packages or their packaging in such a manner that under normal circumstances it remains legible until the end of the carriage. The sender may agree in writing with the carrier that addresses on the packages can be substituted by a statement of numbers, letters or other symbols;\nd) to report the total weight of the goods to be carried on the consignment note;\ne) to load and to stow the goods as agreed in or on the vehicle, and to have them unloaded, unless parties agree otherwise, or unless other obligations arise from the nature of the intended carriage, considering the goods to be carried and the vehicle made available.\n\n2. The sender is not allowed to back out of his obligations mentioned in section 1 a, b, c, and d irrespective of the circumstances he may invoke and the sender is required to compensate the carrier for the damage arising from non-compliance with the obligations mentioned.\n\n3. Without prejudice to the provisions of section 2, the carrier may terminate the contract without any notification if the sender does not fulfil his obligations referred to in section1a and b; however the carrier may only do so after he has set a final deadline for the sender in writing and the sender fails to meet its obligation by the expiry of that deadline. If setting such a deadline would mean that the business operations of the carrier would be unreasonably affected, then the carrier may terminate the contract without granting a deadline as mentioned. The sender may likewise terminate the contract, if he does not fulfil his obligation as mentioned in section 1b.\nTermination is effected by written notice and the agreement is terminated when this notice is received. After termination the sender owes the carrier 75 percent of the agreed freight rate but cannot be held liable for further compensation. If no freight rate was agreed, the applicable freight rate will be as per the law, respectively as per custom, respectively in fairness.\n \n4. The carrier may also give notice of termination of the contract, in case of defective loading or stowing or in case of overloading, but not until the sender has been given the opportunity to rectify the defect or the overloading. If the sender refuses to rectify the defective loading and/or stowing or the overloading, the carrier may either give notice of termination of the contract, or rectify the defects and/or the overloading\nhimself; in both cases the sender is required to pay the carrier an amount of € 500, unless the carrier proves that the damages suffered are in excess of that amount; section 3 does not apply.\n\n5. The sender must repay to the carrier any fine imposed on him as a result of overloading, unless the carrier has fallen short in fulfilling his obli gations pursuant to article 9 sections 1 and 5 or the carrier has not given notice of termination of the contract of carriage on the ground of the previous section, without prejudice to his right to invoke bad faith on the part of the sender. In case the sender can show proof of any fine resulting from violation of article 2.6 section 2 of the Wet Wegvervoer Goederen (Law roadtransport of goods), this stipulation is deleted.\n\n6. Notwithstanding the other sections of this article the sender must compensate to the carrier the damages suffered in so far as caused by the circumstance that the carriage of the goods is or will be fully or partially prohibited or restricted by public authority; however this liability will not exist if the sender proves that the carrier was or could have reasonably been aware of the prohibition or restriction at the time of the contract of carriage being concluded.\n\n\nArticle 5 The consignment note\n\n1. When making the goods available the sender is obliged to submit a consignment note to the carrier which states that these General Terms and Conditions apply to the contract of carriage concluded.\n\n2. The sender is required to complete the consignment note truthfully and in full according to the instructions, and when making the goods available to the carrier he warrants the correctness and completeness of the data supplied by him.\n\n3. The carrier is required to clearly identify himself as the carrier in the consignment note presented by the sender and to sign it and return it to the sender. If the carrier so requires, the sender is required to sign the consignment note. The signature may be printed or substituted by a stamp or any other mark of origin.\n\n4. The consignment note may also be drawn up in the form of an electronic message in accordance with the format and security level as agreed between the parties and in accordance with the manner of sending, saving and registering as agreed between the parties.\n\n\nArticle 6 Evidential value of the consignment note\n\n1. When accepting the goods the carrier is obliged to check the correctness of the statement of the quantity of goods in the consignment note as well as the outward good condition of the goods and their packaging, and in case of deviation to make a note of that on the consignment note. This obligation does not exist if in the opinion of the carrier this would considerably delay the carriage.\n\n2. The consignment note is prima facie evidence, subject to evidence to the contrary, of the conditions of the contract of carriage and the parties to the contract of carriage, and of the receipt of the goods and their packaging in outwardly good condition, and of the weight and quantity of the goods. If the carrier has no\n \nreasonable means to check the correctness of the entries referred to in section 1, then the consignment note will not be evidential of these entries.\n\n\nArticle 7 Freight payment\n\n1. The sender is obliged to pay the freight and further expenses attached to the goods at the time that the consignment note is handed over or the goods are received by the carrier.\n\n2. If freight payable at destination has been agreed, the consignee is obliged to pay the freight, the costs due owing to other reasons relating to the carriage and further charges attached to the goods on delivery of the goods by the carrier; if the consignee does not pay these upon the first reminder, he and the sender are jointly and severally obliged to pay. If, in the case of freight payable at destination, the sender has mentioned in the consignment note that no delivery may be performed without payment of the freight costs, the costs due owing to other reasons relating to the carriage and further expenses attached to the goods, the carrier, if no payment is made, must ask the sender for further instructions which he is obliged to follow up, in so far as reasonably possible, against compensation of costs and damage and possibly payment of a reasonable fee, unless these costs were incurred by his own fault.\n\n3. The carrier has the right to charge all extrajudicial and judicial costs incurred to collect the freight and other amounts, as mentioned in sections 1 and 2, to the parties required to pay the freight and other costs.\nThe extrajudicial collection costs are due as from the time that the debtor is in default. The extrajudicial collection costs are calculated on the basis of the Extrajudicial costs compensation decree (Besluit voor buitengerechtelijke incassokosten, Bulletin of Acts, Orders and Decrees 2012/141) or the most recent version of that decree.\n\n4. The freight, the costs due owing to other reasons relating to the carriage and further expenses attached to the goods are due also if the goods are not delivered at their destination or only partly, damaged or delayed.\n\n5. An appeal to set off claims to pay freight, costs due owing to other reasons relating to the carriage and further expenses attached the goods against claims for any other reason is not permitted.\n\n6. If the sender does not fulfil his obligations referred to in this article, then the carrier is entitled to suspend departure of the vehicle, and in this event the damage arising will be considered as expenses attached to the goods.\n\n\nArticle 8 Instructions of the sender\n\n1. The sender is entitled to change the location where the goods are made available, to designate himself or somebody else as consignee, to change a designation given of the consignee as well as to give orders\nconcerning delivery or to change the place of delivery, provided these instructions do not impede the normal business operations of the carrier. Instructions concerning non-delivery which reach the person having to carry them out on time, must still be carried out however.\n\n2. Instructions may also be given after receipt of the goods by the carrier.\n\n3. The sender is required to compensate the carrier for any damage and costs caused by following the instructions. If as a result of the instructions given the vehicle has been driven to a location which was\n \nnot previously agreed on, then the sender is required to pay a reasonable fee in this respect as well as compensating the damage suffered and expenses incurred.\n\n4. The right to give instructions lapses as soon as the consignee accepts the goods at the place of delivery or the consignee claims compensation from the carrier because the latter did not deliver the goods.\n\n\nArticle 9 Obligations of the carrier\n\n1. The carrier is required to accept the goods agreed on at the place and time and in the manner agreed as well as to communicate the loading capacity of the vehicle to the sender, unless it can be presumed that the sender is aware of this.\n\n2. The carrier is obliged to deliver the goods received for carriage at the destination in the condition in which he has received them.\n\n3. The carrier is obliged to deliver the goods received for carriage within a reasonable time period; if a period of delivery has been agreed in writing delivery must be carried out within this period.\n\n4. If the carrier does not fulfil the obligation referred to in section 1, either party may give notice of termination of the contract in respect of the goods not yet accepted by the carrier. However, the sender may do so only after having set a deadline in writing for the carrier and the carrier does not fulfil his obligation at the expiry of it.\nNotice of termination is given by a written communication to the other party and the contract terminates when this notice is received.\nAfter termination the carrier is required to compensate the sender for the damage which he has suffered as a result of the termination. This compensation, however, cannot amount to more than twice the freight and the sender owes no freight.\n\n5. The carrier is obliged to check the loading, stowing and any overloading by or on behalf of the sender if and in so far as circumstances permit this. If the carrier considers that the loading and stowing is defective, he is\nobliged, notwithstanding the stipulation in article 4 section 4, to make a note of this on the consignment note. If he is not able or in a position to fulfil his control obligation, he may make a note of this on the consignment note.\n\n6. If delivery domicile has been agreed, the carrier must deliver the goods to the door of the address mentioned in the consignment note or to the door of an address which the sender has provided in good time instead of the one in the consignment note pursuant to article 8. If the address is not reachable via a surfaced road or any other reasonable manner, it must be delivered to a location, which is as close as possible to the address originally indicated.\n\n\nArticle 10 Liability of the carrier\n\n1. Except in the case of force majeure the carrier is liable for damage to or loss of the goods and for damage due to delayed delivery in so far as the carrier has not fulfilled the obligations referred to in article 9, sections 2 and 3.\n \n2. The carrier is also liable for acts and omissions of his agents and servants in the same way as for his own acts and omissions..\n\n3. The carrier cannot relieve himself of his liability by invoking the defective condition of the vehicle or of the equipment which he uses unless this was made available to him by the sender, the consignee or the receiver. Material will not mean a ship or a railway carriage containing the vehicle.\n\n\nArticle 11 Special risks\n\nNotwithstanding article 10, the carrier, who does not fulfil his obligations pursuant to article 9 sections 2 and 3, will nevertheless not be liable for the damage arising from this, in so far as the non-observance is the result of the special risks related to one or more of the following circumstances:\na) the carriage of the goods in an open uncovered vehicle, if this was explicitly agreed and specified in the consignment note;\nb) absence of or defective condition of packing of the goods which considering their nature or the manner of carriage should have been sufficiently packed;\nc) handling, loading, stowing or unloading of the goods by the sender, the consignee or persons acting on account of the sender or the consignee;\nd) the nature of certain commodities which owing to causes related to this nature are exposed to total or partial loss or to damage, particularly through combustion, explosion, melting, breakage, corrosion, decay, desiccation, leakage, normal reduction of quality or presence of vermin or rodents;\ne) heat, cold, temperature variations or air humidity, but only if it has not been agreed that the carriage would be performed by means of a vehicle especially equipped to protect the goods from the effects of such conditions;\nf) incompleteness or inadequacy of the address, numbers, letters or signs on the packages;\ng) the fact that it concerns carriage of a live animal.\n\n\nArticle 12 Presumption of exonerating circumstances\n\n1. If the carrier proves that, considering the circumstances of the case, the non-compliance with his obligations pursuant to article 9 sections 2 and 3 may have been a consequence of one or more of the special risks specified in article 11, it will be presumed that the non-compliance was indeed such a consequence. However, the person who is entitled to receive the goods from the carrier may prove that this non-compliance was not wholly or partly caused by one of these special risks.\n\n2. The presumption referred to here above does not apply in the event mentioned in article 11a, if there is an abnormal shortage or an abnormally large loss of packages.\n\n3. If, in accordance with what the parties had agreed, the carriage is performed by means of a vehicle especially equipped to protect the goods from the effects of heat, cold, temperature variations or air humidity, the carrier for the purpose of exoneration of his liability as a result of these effects may only invoke article 11d\nif he proves that all measures had been taken, which he was obliged to take considering the circumstances, with respect to the choice, the maintenance, and the use of such equipment and that he acted in accordance with the special instructions referred to in section five.\n \n4. The carrier may only invoke article 11g, if he proves that all measures had been taken which he was normally obliged to take, considering the circumstances and that he acted in accordance with the special instructions referred to in section five.\n\n5. The special instructions referred to in sections three and four of this article must have been given to the carrier before the start of the carriage and must have been explicitly accepted by him and must be specified in the consignment note if one has been issued for the carriage concerned. Merely the specification of them in the consignment note constitutes no evidence in this event.\n\n\nArticle 13 Compensation\n\n1. The compensation owed by the carrier on the ground of non-compliance with his obligation pursuant to article 9 section 2 is limited to an amount of € 3.40 per kilogram; the carrier is not liable on the grounds\nof the contract of carriage for other damage than that arising from loss of or damage to the goods, such as consequential damage, business stagnation or immaterial damage.\n\n2. The number of kilograms as basis for the calculation of the amount specified in section 1 is the weight of the damaged or not delivered object as specified in the consignment note.\n\n3. If the carrier is liable because he did not deliver within the reasonable period specified in article 9 section 3, the compensation for delay in delivery is limited to once the freight; if the period specified in article 9 section 3 has been agreed in writing, the compensation is limited to twice the freight.\n\n4. The costs of expertise research, salvage and other costs which are incurred to establish and realise the value of the damaged or lost goods and of those delivered with delay are considered as depreciation of the object.\n\n5. If the carrier is liable because of non-compliance with his obligation stemming from Sections 8:1115 para 2 and 8:1118 para 3 BW, or the articles 6 section 1, 19 sections 4, 21 or 25 of these terms and conditions,\ncompensation due by the carrier in this respect shall not exceed the compensation which he would owe in the event of total loss of the goods concerned.\n\n\nArticle 14 Intention to cause damage and wilful recklessness\n\nAn act or an omission by whomever, except the carrier himself, carried out either with the intention to cause damage, or recklessly and in the knowledge that this damage would ensue, does not deprive the carrier of his right of appealing to any exoneration or limitation of his liability.\n\n\nArticle 15 Notice of damage\n\n1. If the goods are delivered by the carrier showing obvious damage or loss and the consignee does not, on receipt of the goods or immediately thereafter, communicate to the carrier a reservation in writing, specifying the general nature of the damage or the loss, then the carrier is presumed to have delivered the goods in the same condition as in which he received them.\n \n2. If the damage or the loss are not externally visible and the consignee has not, within one week of acceptance of the goods, communicated to the carrier a reservation in writing, specifying the general nature of the damage or the loss, then the carrier is likewise presumed to have delivered the goods in the same condition as in which he has received them.\n\n3. If the goods are not delivered within a reasonable or an agreed period and the consignee has not, within one week of acceptance of the goods, communicated to the carrier a reservation in writing, specifying that the goods were not delivered within this period, then the carrier is presumed to have delivered the goods within this period.\n\n\nArticle 16 Right to claim\n\nBoth the sender and the consignee are entitled to demand delivery of the goods in accordance with the obligations of the carrier from the carrier.\n\n\nArticle 17 Cash on delivery (COD)\n\n1. Parties may agree that the goods will charged with a COD amount which, however, shall not exceed the invoice value of the goods. In that case the carrier may deliver the goods only after advance payment of the COD amount in cash, unless the sender has authorised the carrier to accept some other form of payment.\n\n2. If after notice of arrival the consignee does not pay the COD amount in accordance with the form of payment as prescribed by the sender to the carrier, then the carrier must ask the sender for further instructions.\nThe costs related to asking for instructions are for account of the sender. The carrier must follow up the instructions given to him, in so far as this is reasonably possible, in return for reimbursement of costs and possibly a reasonable fee, unless these costs were incurred by his own fault.\nIf the sender gives instructions to the effect that delivery must be carried out in deviation to instructions previously given relating to payment, then these instructions must be given in writing to the carrier.\nIn the absence of instructions the stipulations of article 21 apply mutatis mutandis.\n\n3. The carrier is obliged after delivery of a COD consignment and transfer of the amount to him to remit the COD amount without delay but in any event within two weeks to the sender or to transfer it to his bank or giro account.\n\n4. The period of two weeks specified in section 3 starts on the day that the goods are delivered.\n\n5. The consignee who at the time of delivery knows that the goods are burdened by a COD amount is obliged to pay to the carrier the amount which the latter owes to the sender.\n\n6. If the goods have been delivered without the COD amount having been collected in advance, the carrier is obliged to compensate the sender for the damage to the maximum of the COD amount, unless he proves that there was no fault on his part or on the part of his employees. This obligation does not affect his right of recourse against the consignee.\n\n7. The COD fee due accrues to the sender.\n \n8. All claims against the carrier stemming from a COD condition are limited to one year, counting from the commencement of the day following the day when the goods were delivered or ought to have been delivered.\n\n\nArticle 18 Reservations of the carrier\n\nIn application of the present conditions the carrier reserves the right:\na) to carry the goods by means of the vehicles which are appropriate in his opinion and to keep them if necessary in such vehicles, storage rooms or warehouses as he thinks fit, irrespective of whether these vehicles, storage rooms or warehouses belong to the carrier or third parties;\nb) to have the free choice of the route for carriage, and likewise to deviate from the customary route. He is also entitled to call on places as he thinks fit for the operation of his enterprise.\n\n\nArticle 19 Prevention after receipt\n\n1. If upon receipt of the goods by the carrier the carriage cannot reasonably be effected, continued or completed or within a reasonable time period , the carrier is obliged to communicate this to the sender. Both carrier and sender are then entitled to give notice of termination of the contract.\n\n2. Notice of termination shall be given by notifying the other party in writing and the contract will terminate when this written notification is received.\n\n3. The carrier is not obliged to effect further carriage to the place of destination and is entitled to unload the goods and store these at a place fit for the purpose; the sender is entitled to take possession of the goods. The costs incurred with respect to the goods in connection with the termination are for account of the sender, under reservation of section 4.\n\n4. Without prejudice to force majeure the carrier is obliged to compensate the sender for the damage which he suffers as a result of the termination of the contract.\n\n\nArticle 20 Stack-on transport, through transport\n\n1. If part of the carriage, whether or not after transhipment of the goods, takes place on inland waterways, the liability of the carrier for this part is defined by articles 9 and 13 of the Algemene Veerboot- en Beurtvaartcondities.\n\n2. If, after delivery of the goods which he has carried, the carrier undertakes to have the goods carried onwards, he does so in the capacity of a forwarding agent and his liability in this capacity is then limited to € 3.40 per kilogram for lost or damaged goods; no further compensation for any kind of damage shall be owed.\n\n\nArticle 21 Storage in the event that the consignee does not show up\n\n1. If the consignee does not show up after notice of arrival of the goods, , if he does not begin taking delivery of the goods, if he does not continue to accept delivery of the goods regularly and with appropriate haste, if he\n \nrefuses to accept the goods or to sign for receipt, the carrier may store the goods for account and risk of the sender, observing due care, in a manner and location of his determination, if necessary also in the vehicle in which the goods were carried; the carrier is obliged to inform the sender.\n\n2. The carrier, taking section 1 into consideration may also proceed to storage or garaging, if furnishment of security as specified in article 23 section 5 is refused, or if a dispute arises over the amount or the nature of the security to be furnished.\n\n3. Except in the event of seizure, the goods may be sold publicly or privately for account of the sender without any legal authorisation being required, but only after expiry of one week after a notice in writing by registered mail to the sender of the intention to sell.\n\n4. The sale may be effected without observing any term and without prior notice if the goods are perishable or storage may be detrimental or give rise to damage or danger for the vicinity. If prior notice was not given, the carrier is obliged to inform the sender of the sale afterwards.\n\n5. With regard to livestock the term specified in section 3 is three days, subject to the right of the carrier to proceed to the sale without respecting any term and without prior notice if the condition of the livestock so warrants. If prior notice was not given, the carrier is obliged to inform the sender of the sale afterwards.\n\n6. The carrier will retain the proceeds from the goods sold, after deduction of the amount of any COD and a fee due to the carrier in connection therewith and of everything due to the carrier in connection with the goods sold, both for freight as well as the costs or storage and parking and other costs and damages, for the sender for six months following the acceptance of the goods for carriage, at the expiry of which term he shall put the amount retained in judicial custody.\n\n\nArticle 22 Storage before, during and after carriage\n\nIf sender and carrier agree that the carrier will store the goods before or during the carriage as agreed, or will do so on completion of the carriage, such storage is effected under application of the General Storage Terms and Conditions, pursuant to which sender and carrier are respectively considered as the depositor and the custodian.\n\n\nArticle 23 Right of lien\n\n1. The carrier has a right of lien on goods and documents in his possession in connection with the contract of carriage towards any person who demands delivery of same. This right does not accrue to him if, at the time of receipt of the goods for carriage, he had reason to doubt the right of the sender to make the goods available for carriage to him.\n\n2. The right of lien applies likewise to charges attached to the goods by way of COD as well as to the COD fee to which he is entitled, for which he is not obliged to accept security.\n\n3. The carrier may also exercise the right of lien against the sender for reason of what is still owed to him with respect to previous contracts of carriage.\n\n4. Likewise, the carrier may exercise the right of lien against the consignee who in this capacity became a party to previous contracts of carriage for reason of what is still owed to him with respect to these contracts.\n \n5. If when settling the invoice a dispute arises over the amount due or if there is a need for a calculation to be made for the determination of what is due that cannot be made quickly, then the party demanding delivery is obliged to pay forthwith the part which the parties agree is due and to furnish security for the part in dispute or for the part for which the amount has not yet been established.\n\n\nArticle 24 Right of pledge\n\n1. All the goods, documents and monies in possession of the carrier in connection with the contract of carriage serve as pledge for all claims which he has against the sender.\n\n2. Except for the cases where the sender has been declared bankrupt, has been granted moratorium of payments or in has been declared subject to a debt reorganisation scheme for natural persons, the carrier shall never be entitled to sell the pledged objects without permission from the Court in accordance with Section 3:248 para 2 BW.\n\n\nArticle 25 Lost goods\n\nIf the goods have not been delivered within thirty days from the day when they were accepted for carriage and if their whereabouts is unknown, the goods will be considered as lost.\nIf within one year after the carrier has paid compensation for non-delivery of the goods to the person who was entitled to delivery of same, these goods or some of them appear to be (again) in possession of the carrier, the latter is obliged to communicate this circumstance to the sender or the consignee in writing, whichever has expressed the wish to this effect in writing, and then the sender respectively the consignee has the right for thirty days from receipt of such communication to demand as yet delivery of these goods against reimbursement of the compensation he has received. The same applies if the carrier has paid no compensation for non-delivery, subject however to the period of one year to start from the day after the day when the goods ought to have been delivered. If the sender or the consignee respectively does not avail himself of this right, article 21 applies.\n\n\nArticle 26 Indemnification; Himalaya clause\n\n1. The sender who fails to meet any obligation which the law or these conditions impose on him is obliged to indemnify the carrier against all damages which he might suffer as a result of this non-compliance when he is held liable by a third party on account of the carriage of the goods.\n\n2. When servants and agents of the carrier are held liable on account of the carriage of the goods, these persons may invoke each liability limitation and/or exoneration which the carrier can invoke pursuant to these conditions or any other legal or contractual provision.\n\n\nArticle 27 Default interest\n\nPursuant to Section 6:119 BW, parties owe statutory default interest on any amounts owed.\n \n \nArticle 28 Limitation period\n\n1. All judicial claims based on or related to the contract of carriage are limited to one year.\n\n2. In so far as a carrier seeks recourse against a person whose services the carrier has used in completing the contract of carriage to recoup what the carrier is due to the sender or the consignee a new limitation period of three months begins from the time as stipulated in Section 8:1720 para 1 BW.\n\n\nArticle 29 Choice of court; choice of law\n\n1. All disputes arising from or relating to domestic carriage by road between parties residing in the Netherlands can exclusively be adjudicated by the competent court in Rotterdam, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing.\n\n2. All legal relationships ensuing from or relating to the contract of carriage are governed by Dutch law.\n\n\nExplanatory note\nInstead of a judicial decision, parties can also opt to submit their dispute to arbitration. TAMARA specialises in arbitration in the areas of transport, storage, logistics, international trade, and the shipping and shipbuilding industries. Stichting vervoeradres sits on the board of TAMARA to represent the interests of road transport and logistics services. Since September 2011 it is no longer possible to submit cases for arbitration to the Stichting Arbitrage voor Logistiek.\n\nIf you wish to make use of the arbitration services of TAMARA, then include the arbitration clause below in your contract of carriage.\n\n‘All disputes ensuing from or connected to this contract will be subject to Arbitration in Rotterdam in accordance with the TAMARA Arbitration Regulations. Article 29 Paragraph 1 AVC 2002 does not apply to this contract.’\n\nThe parties can also decide after the conflict has arisen to submit the case for arbitration. This requires a written agreement between the parties.\n\n\nStichting Vervoeradres facilitates the logistics chain with widely accepted bilateral general terms and conditions (such as the General Conditions of Transport, AVC). Key to this is the principle of a well-balanced distribution of risks, sectoral acceptance and transparency regarding the legal status both of the sender (shipper), the logistics service provider and the consignee. The Foundation maintains contacts on an international level for purposes of enhancing the legal status of the various parties in the logistics chain (as formulated in the CMR Convention).\n \n \nBeurtvaartadres facilitates the logistics chain in the mutual exchange and storage of data on logistics transactions, for purposes of reducing the overall transaction costs. Its expertise, solutions and products are made available to this end. Beurtvaartadres expressly strives to provide services which apply corporate social responsibility and aims to raise awareness of its CSR policy among its colleagues, customers and suppliers.\nBeurtvaartadres is independent and acts on behalf of the employers’ organisations EVO, Goederenvervoer Nederland, Nederlandsch Binnenvaartbureau and Transport en Logistiek Nederland.\n\nBeurtvaartadres provides its logistics services through the following entities:\n\nBeurtvaartadres document\nBeurtvaartadres document ensures that businesses can send their goods with the correct legal documents, via road, water or by air.\n\nTransFollow\nTransFollow supports the logistics chain with common, user-friendly ICT systems for data exchange and to improve data quality.
