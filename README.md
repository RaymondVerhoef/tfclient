# TransFollow command line client

## Build
This sample uses the GO build system for cross platform builds. 

## Run
To run this client you will need two config files in either JSON or YAML. One file holds the confidential configuration 
and the global settings, the other the scenario.

Additionally you can use JSON templates and attachments, both of which have their own directory. The attachments directory will be gitignored.
